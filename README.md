# Overview

This assignment is trying to recreate a game I played in the past to see how well I can interpret it into the arcade library. The game has the player work on an assignment at a desk, but also has to maintain the player's bladder, hunger, and sleep. The player refills these stats by walking to the respective room and interacting with it. The game ends when either one of the status bars reaches 0%, or the player finishes the project by reaching 100%.
